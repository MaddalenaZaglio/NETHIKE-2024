###DATA
Goele Bossaert and Nadine Meidert coded peer support ties among 64 characters in the Harry Potter books. Each author coded four of seven books using NVivo, with the seventh book coded by both and serving to assess inter-rater reliability. The first six books concentrated on adolescent interactions, were studied in their paper, and are made available here. The peer support ties mean voluntary emotional, instrumental, or informational support, or praise from one living, adolescent character to another within the book's pages. In addition, nodal attributes name, school year (which doubles as their age), gender, and their house assigned by the sorting hat are included.

###LICENCE
